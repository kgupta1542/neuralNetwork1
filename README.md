# neuralNetwork1
My first attempt at a very simple neural network.

This is really, really simple attempt at a nerual network. I have written it in PHP for now, and have not used any existing libraries,
such as TensorFlow, so that I have a full understanding of the process. I will soon upload versions of this, or a similar neural network,
in both Python and Java with the optimization provided by existing tools.

Any feedback would be greatly appreciated.

*Note: I know that the second output of flowerColorNetwork2 is redundant, but I wanted to test out how calculating outputs for two
different outputs would work.
